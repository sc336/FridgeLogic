This incomplete game involves dragging randomly selected words into an amusing order.  Players compete to make the most amusing lines (as judged by each other) in a short time limit.

I wrote this in 2016, and recovered it from an old archive in 2019.  I haven't attempted to build it again since then, so if you want to, you're on your own for now.  That said the Android Studio boilerplate is all there.
